SnakeBite! My very best first classic game.
about 40 years ago (1985...), I had an opportunity to see a PC(IBM or apple) for only one night. I open the book and there is a code for the Snake Bite game. I just follow the code and Voila! snake run!!
After 40 years I play the Snakebite game again, the difference is that I programmed it by myself. I chased my dream for a long time, but I did not realize that I had a dream. My dream came true because of modern technic and the Internet. If I can do this, anyone can.
